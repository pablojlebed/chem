                CRITICAL: The 'client:only="true"' directive is mandatory for this component.
                It tells Astro to skip rendering on the server and load the component
                (including all its JavaScript) exclusively on the client (browser).
                This is necessary because the component relies heavily on browser APIs
                like Chart.js and complex DOM manipulation.
