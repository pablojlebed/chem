      About Me
    </h1>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
      {/* Consistent paragraph style */}
      I’m Pablo, a freelance Analytical Chemist with +15 years of experience in precise,
      quality-focused chemical analysis. I specialize in atomic spectroscopy, trace
      metal analysis, and method validation for complex matrices — especially in
      the battery materials, nanomedicine, environmental, and radiochemistry sectors.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
      {/* Consistent paragraph style */}
      I’ve worked in state-of-the-art labs and have led analytical projects from
      method development to reporting. Now I help companies who need top-quality
      results but don’t want to build a full in-house team.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
      {/* Consistent paragraph style */}
      I also support labs with quality management and continuous improvement initiatives
      — from refining processes and documentation to aligning with ISO 17025. If
      you're looking to boost efficiency, traceability, and audit readiness, I can
      help you build systems that work.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
      {/* Consistent paragraph style */}
      I combine deep technical skills with sharp communication and reliable delivery.
      My work is thorough, well-documented, and tailored to your needs.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">

      Whether you need support on a short-term project or ongoing collaboration,
      I’m here to make your data rock-solid.
