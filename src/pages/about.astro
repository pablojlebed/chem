      About Me
    </h1>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      I’m Pablo, a freelance Analytical Chemist with +15 years of experience in
      precise, quality-focused chemical analysis. I specialize in atomic
      spectroscopy, trace metal analysis, and method validation for complex
      matrices — especially in the battery materials, nanomedicine,
      environmental, and radiochemistry sectors.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      I’ve worked in state-of-the-art labs and have led analytical projects from
      method development to reporting. Now I help companies who need top-quality
      results but don’t want to build a full in-house team.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      I also support labs with quality management and continuous improvement
      initiatives — from refining processes and documentation to aligning with
      ISO 17025. If you're looking to boost efficiency, traceability, and audit
      readiness, I can help you build systems that work.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      I combine deep technical skills with sharp communication and reliable
      delivery. My work is thorough, well-documented, and tailored to your
      needs.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Whether you need support on a short-term project or ongoing collaboration,
      I’m here to make your data rock-solid.
    </p>
