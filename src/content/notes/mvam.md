title: Minimal Viable Analytical Method
description: A pragmatic, agile framework derived from the "minimum viable product" concept, designed to rapidly establish just enough analytical capability—such as basic sample preparation and simplified calibration—to generate crucial, timely, directional data for accelerated decision-making in exploratory and early-stage R&D.

## Accelerating R&D: The Minimum Viable Analytical Method

The infographic above illustrates a common situation in analytical laboratories that support R&D activities.

If your R&D colleagues are:

- enthusiastic,

- want results yesterday, and

- are not particularly interested in how things work in your lab,

then the **Minimum Viable Analytical Method (MVAM)** can become an invaluable concept.

You will often hear the question:
**“Is the method good?”**

Naturally, you might feel inclined to reply:
**“What does good mean for you, my dear R&D colleague?”**

At that moment, a harsh truth becomes evident: analytical chemistry is not the most popular or widely pursued subdiscipline of chemistry.

Because of this, we—analytical chemists—must be ready to guide our colleagues, and by extension, support our organizations in making sound decisions.

**Questions to Reflect On**

- What makes a method a method?

- What can be removed from a method while still providing meaningful, directional data?

- Can you clearly explain why?

For further details, see the accompanying slides:

I hope this reflection helps you.
