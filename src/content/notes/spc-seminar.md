## Dr. Donald J. Wheeler’s “Understanding SPC” Seminar — An Exceptional Resource

I highly recommend Dr. Donald J. Wheeler’s **Understanding SPC** seminar, now available in 15 free sessions on YouTube — an invaluable resource for anyone diving into Statistical Process Control (SPC).

Presented by [SPC Press](https://www.spcpress.com/), this seminar offers a rich exploration into process behavior charts and SPC principles.  
Each approximately one-hour session covers key topics such as:

- Understanding variation and its impact on decision-making  
- Establishing and interpreting control limits  
- Recognizing the proper — and improper — uses of SPC tools  
- Avoiding common data analysis pitfalls

Dr. Wheeler — an acclaimed statistician, author of over 20 books, and recipient of the prestigious Deming Medal — delivers these concepts with unmatched clarity and practical insight. His teachings have influenced quality practices across industries worldwide.
